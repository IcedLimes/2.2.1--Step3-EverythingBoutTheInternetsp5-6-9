    <h1>How to Prevent WIFI Router Hacks & Secure your network</h1>
    
    <h2>Change defualt login credentials</h2>
    <p>Changing your passwords to be unique and long can help prevent attacks on your router because hackers will be less prone to guessing your password
        :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most routers use default usernames/passwords (e.g., admin/admin).
        </li>
        <li>Change the admin password to a strong, unique one</li>
        <li>Use long passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
        
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Use Strong WiFi Password & Encryption</h2>
    <p>Use WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if WPA3 isnâ€™t available) WPA3 is a security protocol used to protect wireless networks. It encrypts data transmitted over WiFi, preventing unauthorized access</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Enable Firewall & Security Features 
    </h2>
    <p>Most routers have a built-in firewall. A firewall is a security system that can help monitors and controls network traffic based on predefined rules. It acts as a barrier between your private network and external threats, preventing unauthorized access and cyberattacks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prevent phshing (aka camilla and bob)</li>
        <li>Protect againist malware and cyber threats (rip fishtank)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>VPN</h2>
    <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet traffic.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>VPNS can help protect your security by replacing your IP address to a different part of the world</li>
        <li>VPNS can also help bypass restrictions</li>
